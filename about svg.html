SVG is a W3C recommendation

SVG Advantages
Advantages of using SVG over other image formats (like JPEG and GIF) are:

SVG images can be created and edited with any text editor
SVG images can be searched, indexed, scripted, and compressed
SVG images are scalable
SVG images can be printed with high quality at any resolution
SVG images are zoomable (and the image can be zoomed without degradation)
SVG is an open standard
SVG files are pure XML
The main competitor to SVG is Flash.

The biggest advantage SVG has over Flash is the compliance with other standards (e.g. XSL and the DOM). Flash relies on proprietary technology that is not open source.

Creating SVG Images
SVG images can be created with any text editor, but it is often more convenient to create SVG images with a drawing program, like Inkscape.
